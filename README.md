# User Registration Form

## 📖 Project Description
This project implements a **semantic HTML registration form** that demonstrates best practices in form structure, accessibility, and HTML5 compliance.  
The form collects user details such as personal information, account details, and preferences.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice:
- Semantic HTML form implementation
- Proper accessibility standards (labels, fieldsets, legends)
- Structuring an HTML document without CSS
- Clear documentation through a README

## 📂 File Structure
```
your-repo-name/
├── index.html   # Complete semantic HTML form
└── README.md    # Documentation of the project
```

---

## 📝 Implementation Notes
- **Semantic HTML**: `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>` used to provide meaning to form sections.  
- **Accessibility**: Each input is associated with its label via `for` and `id`.  
- **HTML5 Standards**: Includes `required`, `type="email"`, `type="date"`, and `type="password"`.  
- **Structure**: Divided into sections (Personal Information, Account Information, Preferences).

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Fill out the form fields and click **Register**.

## ✅ Features
- Validates email format automatically.
- Requires all key fields before submission.
- Clearly separated sections for better readability.
- Demonstrates semantic HTML practices.

---

## 📌 Notes
- No CSS styling is included — focus is purely on semantic structure.
- The form’s action is set to `#` (placeholder). In a real application, this would point to a server endpoint.
